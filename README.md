<ol>
<li>Sort a given set of n integer elements using Quick Sort method and compute its time complexity. Run the program for varied values of n> 5000 and record the time taken to sort. Plot a graph of the time taken versus non graph sheet. The elements can be read from a file or can be generated using the random number generator. Demonstrate how the divide and- conquer method works along with its time complexity analysis: worst case, average case and best case.</li>
<li>Sort a given set of n integer elements using Merge Sort method and compute its time complexity. Run the program for varied values of n> 5000, and record the time taken to sort. Plot a graph of the time taken versus non graph sheet. The elements can be read from a file or can be generated using random number generator. Demonstrate how the divide and- conquer method works along with its time complexity analysis: worst case, average case and best case.</li>
